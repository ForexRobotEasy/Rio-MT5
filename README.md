# Rio MT5 Forex Software

## Overview
Rio MT5 is a forex trading software developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to identify trading opportunities based on trend and moving averages indicators. This readme file provides an overview of the code implementation and describes how the software works.

## Code Description
The code is written in MQL5 language and consists of several sections, including necessary library inclusion, variable definition, initialization, deinitialization, and iteration functions.

### Libraries
The code includes the following libraries:
- Trade.mqh: Provides trading functionality
- PositionInfo.mqh: Retrieves position information
- Trend.mqh: Implements the trend indicator
- MovingAverages.mqh: Implements the moving averages indicator

### Variables
The code defines the following variables:
- `lotSize`: Default lot size for trading
- `stopLoss`: Default stop loss in pips
- `takeProfit`: Default take profit in pips

### Objects
The code creates several objects to handle trading, position information, trend, and moving averages:
- `trade`: Trading class object from the Trade library
- `posInfo`: Position information class object from the PositionInfo library
- `trend`: Trend indicator class object from the Trend library
- `ma`: Moving averages indicator class object from the MovingAverages library

### Initialization
The `OnInit` function is called during initialization and initializes the trading and position information classes. It also creates instances of the trend and moving averages indicators.

### Deinitialization
The `OnDeinit` function is called during deinitialization and destroys the instances of the trend and moving averages indicators.

### Iteration
The `OnCalculate` function is called for each new price tick. It checks for new trading opportunities based on the trend and moving averages indicators. If a buy or sell condition is met and no existing position exists, a new position is opened using the `Buy` or `Sell` methods of the `trade` object.
